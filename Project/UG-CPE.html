<h2>Undergraduate Programs - Computer Engineering</h2>

<h3>Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BS CPE)</h3>

<p> Computer Engineering is the discipline that focuses on the design, installation, and maintenance of digital devices and appropriate software to effectively and efficiently meet the scientific, technological and administrative needs of business and industry in a global economy. It combines elements of electronics and communications engineering and computer science to understand the hardware/software interface common to computing and information systems. A computer engineer may perform tasks such as the design of a microprocessor or the development of an embedded system that may be used in applications that range from desktops to hand-held devices.</p>

<h3>Program Decription</h3>

<p>Computer Engineering is a combination of elements of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, which deals with the design, and utilization of computers. The parent discipline of Computer Engineering is Electrical Engineering with which it shares considerable commonality. Computer Engineering seeks to match efficient digital devices with appropriate software to meet the scientific, technological and administrative needs of business and industry in a global economy. The program provides students with a background that prepares them for careers in embedded systems design, computer system operations, and systems support.</p>

<p> The Computer Engineering curriculum provides students with a foundation in basic science, mathematics and the humanities. Written and oral communication skills are emphasized and developed throughout the program, as is team project work (laboratory experiments, reports, and thesis) and an appreciation of the ethical and professional responsibilities of an engineer. The program also includes a one-trimester practicum in a locally or internationally recognized engineering or computing institution..</p>

<h3>Fields of Specialization - Machine Learning & Intelligent Systems</h3>

<h4>Machine Learning</h4>
<p>Machine learning is most commonly used to mean the application of induction algorithms, which is one step in the knowledge discovery process. It is the field of scientific study that concentrates on induction algorithms and on other algorithms that can be said to “learn.”</p>

<h4>Intelligent Systems</h4>
<p>It is a system that learns during its existence. In other words, it learns, for each situation, the response, which permits it to reach its objectives. It continually acts, mentally and externally, and by acting reaches its objectives more often than pure chance would indicate.</p>

<h4>Embedded & Real-Time Systems & Computer Hardware Architecture</h4>
<h4>Embedded Systems</h4>
<p>A specialized computer system that is part of a larger system or machine. Typically, an embedded system is housed on a single microprocessor board with the programs stored in ROM. Virtually all appliances that have a digital interface — watches, microwaves, VCRs, cars — utilize embedded systems. Some embedded systems include an operating system, but many are so specialized that the entire logic can be implemented as a single program.</p>

<h4>Real-time Systems</h4>
<p>The term is used to describe a number of different computer features. For example, real-time operating systems are systems that respond to input immediately. They are used for such tasks as navigation, in which the computer must react to a steady flow of new information without interruption. Most general-purpose operating systems are not real-time because they can take a few seconds, or even minutes, to react. Real time can also refer to events simulated by a computer at the same speed that they would occur in real life. In graphics animation, for example, a real-time program would display objects moving across the screen at the same speed that they would actually move.</p>

<h4>Computer Architecture</h4>
<p>The physical configuration, logical structure, formats, protocols, and operational sequences for processing data, controlling the configuration, and controlling the operations.</p>

<h4>Multimedia Systems</h4>
<p>This is the use of computers to present text, graphics, video, animation, and sound in an integrated way. Long touted as the future revolution in computing, multimedia applications were, until the mid-90s, uncommon due to the expensive hardware required. With increases in performance and decreases in price, however, multimedia is now commonplace. Nearly all PCs are capable of displaying video, though the resolution available depends on the power of the computer’s video adapter and CPU.</p>
