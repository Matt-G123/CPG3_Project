<h2>Undergraduate Programs - Computer Engineering</h2>

<h3>Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BS CPE)</h3>

<p> Computer Engineering is the discipline that focuses on the design, installation, and maintenance of digital devices and appropriate software to effectively and efficiently meet the scientific, technological and administrative needs of business and industry in a global economy. It combines elements of electronics and communications engineering and computer science to understand the hardware/software interface common to computing and information systems. A computer engineer may perform tasks such as the design of a microprocessor or the development of an embedded system that may be used in applications that range from desktops to hand-held devices.</p>

<h3>Program Decription</h3>

<p>Computer Engineering is a combination of elements of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, which deals with the design, and utilization of computers. The parent discipline of Computer Engineering is Electrical Engineering with which it shares considerable commonality. Computer Engineering seeks to match efficient digital devices with appropriate software to meet the scientific, technological and administrative needs of business and industry in a global economy. The program provides students with a background that prepares them for careers in embedded systems design, computer system operations, and systems support.</p>

<p> The Computer Engineering curriculum provides students with a foundation in basic science, mathematics and the humanities. Written and oral communication skills are emphasized and developed throughout the program, as is team project work (laboratory experiments, reports, and thesis) and an appreciation of the ethical and professional responsibilities of an engineer. The program also includes a one-trimester practicum in a locally or internationally recognized engineering or computing institution..</p>

<h3>Fields of Specialization</h3>
<h3>Machine Learning & Intelligent Systems</h3>
<h4>Machine Learning</h4>

<p> Machine learning is most commonly used to mean the application of induction algorithms, which is one step in the knowledge discovery process. It is the field of scientific study that concentrates on induction algorithms and on other algorithms that can be said to “learn.”</p>
