<h2>Undergraduate Programs - Electronics Engineering</h2>

<h3>Bachelor of Science in Electronics Engineering (BS ECE)</h3>

<p>The Electronics Engineering degree program produces engineers with greater depth and breadth of knowledge of electronics particularly in preparation for the following fields: telecommunications, radio and TV broadcasting and other communications engineering technologies, industrial electronics and instrumentation, semiconductor applications and manufacture, systems analysis and controls engineering, and the software and hardware areas of computer science and engineering.</p>


<p>The ECE Department offers elective courses that will initiate graduates into the more recent areas of digital signal processing; neural networks and fuzzy logic; VLSI technology and linear and nonlinear control theory; and fiber optics communications and digital communications.</p>

<h3>Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Electronics Engineering Honors (BS-MS ECE)</h3>

<p> The BS-MS ECE or BS/MS Honors program is a five year accelerated course designed for students with exceptional academic and research aptitude. The student is awarded both the BS and MS degrees upon completion of all academic requirements. The first three years of study are identical to those of the regular BS Program. At the end of the junior year, qualified students may opt to enter the program. Students already in the honors program may likewise return to the regular BS track if they choose.</p>

<p> Electronics engineering is a discipline that typifies the science and technology of design, development, implementation, application, operation and integration of devices and systems involving the flow of electrons or other carriers of electric charge. This also includes devices that utilizes electromagnetic phenomena for communications, such as in wireless communication and fiber optics. As a growing discipline, its practical applications have become ubiquitous in todayâ€™s society and in a wide range of industries.</p>

<p> The program is composed of 36 units inclusive of Thesis (6), Methods of Research (3), and Advanced Mathematics courses (6). Publication in a refereed journal is also a requirement together with a written or oral comprehensive examination.</p>

<p> The BSMS honors program in Electronics Engineering is designed for academically exceptional undergraduate students that intend to pursue an advanced study in electronics engineering and aim to earn two (2) degrees upon graduation. It also provides an opportunity for the student to further enhance his/her skills in preparation for research and development career or in academe. It also aids the student in gaining a clear and wide-ranging view of the current electronics and communications technologies as well as an exposure to emerging technologies related to the field of electronics.</p>
