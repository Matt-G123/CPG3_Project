            <p style="font-size: 25px">Computer Engineering is a combination of elements of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, which deals with the design, and utilization of computers. The parent discipline of Computer Engineering is Electrical Engineering with which it shares considerable commonality. Computer Engineering seeks to match efficient digital devices with appropriate software to meet the scientific, technological and administrative needs of business and industry in a global economy. The program provides students with a background that prepares them for careers in embedded systems design, computer system operations, and systems support. The Computer Engineering curriculum provides students with a foundation in basic science, mathematics and the humanities. Written and oral communication skills are emphasized and developed throughout the program, as is team project work (laboratory experiments, reports, and thesis) and an appreciation of the ethical and professional responsibilities of an engineer. The program also includes a one-trimester practicum in a locally or internationally recognized engineering or computing institution.</p>

                <div class="CustomShape PH"> The Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering (DECE) is one of the largest departments in the Gokongwei College of Engineering at De La Salle University. Currently, the department has twenty-six academic personnel, one non-academic personnel, and eight support personnel providing technical, professional and administrative services. Different laboratories have been established for each area of specialization. A number of specialized modern research equipment was acquired from the Department of Science and Technology through the Engineering and Science Education Program. The equipment is used by the personnel and students for research and development.

                The Research Center of the Department will also provide consultancy services to industry, it also conducts industrially relevant research. During the starting phase, the Center will identify research areas which have elements of research, service, and development. The results from the research in an identified area should be available as a service to our local industry. Aside from undertaking collaborative research projects with industry, the Research Center of the ECE department also aims to train industry-oriented researchers and engineers through seminars or short course training.
